# Annotated DocSet

Annotated DocSet is a synthetic dataset with instance and semantic segmentations.  The source documents are [PubLayNet](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/publaynet/) and [IAMonDo](https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/iam-online-document-database) which are used to construct mixed-media documents.  The annotations are automatically generated by matching during the construction of the new documents into HDF5 files.  More details are available in our paper "Classification of handwritten annotations in mixed-media documents" (CRV 2022). 


## Getting Data

This dataset uses two external datasets to construct a synthentic datasets and they must be downloaded for the authors websites.

1. PubLayNet: Download the dataset [here](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/publaynet/). Note: We used the validation set only due to the limited size of the IAMonDo dataset.

2. IAMonDo: Download the dataset [here](https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/iam-online-document-database)
